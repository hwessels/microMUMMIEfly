# microMUMMIEfly

MicroMUMMIE is a specific model, implemented within the [MUMMIE](https://ohlerlab.mdc-berlin.de/files/duke/MUMMIE/) framework, for predicting microRNA binding sites using PAR-CLIP data.  Thus, while MUMMIE can be used for many different bioinformatic modeling tasks, microMUMMIE is a specific model for a specific task. Here you find the guidelines for the installation and usage of microMUMMIE specific to fly data. For human, please defer to this [page](https://ohlerlab.mdc-berlin.de/software/microMUMMIE_99/). 

### 1.  Installation

#### Install Base Packages

##### Install PARalyzer

MicroMUMMIE microRNA binding site predictions depend on [PARalyzer](https://ohlerlab.mdc-berlin.de/software/PARalyzer_85/) output files. Please begin by installing PARalyzer implemented in [PARpipe](https://github.com/ohlerlab/PARpipe).


and MUMMIE (you will also need twoBitToFa, which must be in your PATH).  PARalyzer uses Bowtie to align PAR-CLIP reads to the genome and then constructs a smooth signal curve that can be used for peak-calling to find (roughly) where an RNA-binding protein (such as Argonaute) binds.  However, rather than using a peak-caller, microMUMMIE instead uses a hidden Markov model (HMM) to find the most probable miRNA seed match near the PARalyzer peak.  This allows microMUMMIE to weigh multiple forms of evidence (e.g., T-to-C conversion rates, evolutionary conservation, RNA sequence) in making the most informed prediction.  The base MUMMIE package also includes the microMUMMIE scripts and models.
